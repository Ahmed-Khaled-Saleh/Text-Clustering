# Text-Clustering

Text clustering aims to assign a label to a portion of the given corpus. It's minly used with unlabeld text data.  This project walks through the process, End-To-End, to apply different clustering algorithms. K-means, Agglomerative and Expectation maximization Algorithms are applied. Champoion model is chosen and we apply Error analysis on it using the standard clsutering metrics, like Silhouette and Kappa.



## How to Run the code
- Install python  scientific stack(Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, matplot, sklean).
- Install NLP-related libraries: NLTK, GENSIM.
